## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes (PHP)

#### **vehicles.php:**
```php
// Added pre-delete validation
if ($action === 'delete') {
    $checkStmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT COUNT(*) as work_count FROM working_details WHERE vehicle_id = :id');
    $checkStmt->execute([':id' => $id]);
    $result = $checkStmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
    
    if ($result['work_count'] > 0) {
        throw new RuntimeException('Cannot delete vehicle: This vehicle has ' . $result['work_count'] . ' work order(s).');
    }
    
    // Safe to delete
    $stmt = $pdo->prepare('DELETE FROM vehicle WHERE vehicle_id=:id');
    $stmt->execute([':id'=>$id]);
}

// Enhanced query with work order count
$rows = $pdo->query('
  SELECT v.*, 
         CONCAT(c.first_name, " ", c.last_name) AS customer_name,
         COUNT(w.work_id) as work_count
  FROM vehicle v 
  JOIN customer c ON c.customer_id = v.customer_id 
  LEFT JOIN working_details w ON v.vehicle_id = w.vehicle_id
  GROUP BY v.vehicle_id
  ORDER BY v.vehicle_id DESC 
')->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
```

#### **mechanics.php:**
```php
// Added pre-delete validation
if ($action === 'delete') {
    $checkStmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT COUNT(*) as work_count FROM working_details WHERE assigned_mechanic_id = :id');
    $checkStmt->execute([':id' => $id]);
    $result = $checkStmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
    
    if ($result['work_count'] > 0) {
        throw new RuntimeException('Cannot delete mechanic: This mechanic has ' . $result['work_count'] . ' work order(s).');
    }
    
    // Safe to delete
    $stmt = $pdo->prepare('DELETE FROM mechanics WHERE mechanic_id=:id');
    $stmt->execute([':id'=>$id]);
}

// Enhanced query with work order count
$rows = $pdo->query('
  SELECT m.*, 
         COUNT(w.work_id) as work_count
  FROM mechanics m
  LEFT JOIN working_details w ON m.mechanic_id = w.assigned_mechanic_id
  GROUP BY m.mechanic_id
  ORDER BY m.mechanic_id DESC 
')->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
```

#### **work_orders.php:**
```php
// No delete functionality (work orders are historical records)
// Update functionality for status, completion date, notes
if ($action === 'update') {
    $work_id = (int)($_POST['work_id'] ?? 0);
    $status = trim($_POST['status'] ?? 'pending');
    $completion_date = $_POST['completion_date'] !== '' ? $_POST['completion_date'] : null;
    $notes = trim($_POST['notes'] ?? '');
    
    $stmt = $pdo->prepare('UPDATE working_details SET status=:st, completion_date=:cd, notes=:n WHERE work_id=:id');
    $stmt->execute([':st'=>$status, ':cd'=>$completion_date, ':n'=>$notes, ':id'=>$work_id]);
    
    // Auto-create invoice when completed
    if ($status === 'completed') {
        createInvoiceForWork($pdo, $work_id);
    }
}
```

### Frontend Changes (HTML/CSS/JS)

#### **Common to All Pages:**
1. **Replaced old header/footer:**
   ```php
   // OLD
   require __DIR__ . '/header.php';
   require __DIR__ . '/footer.php';
   
   // NEW
   $current_page = 'page_name';
   require __DIR__ . '/header_modern.php';
   require __DIR__ . '/footer_modern.php';
   ```

2. **Added page header section:**
   ```html
   <div class="mf-content-header">
       <div>
           <h1 class="mf-page-title">Page Name</h1>
           <p class="text-muted">Description</p>
       </div>
       <div>
           <button class="btn btn-primary" data-bs-toggle="modal">
               <i class="fas fa-plus me-2"></i>Add Item
           </button>
       </div>
   </div>
   ```

3. **Wrapped table in card:**
   ```html
   <div class="card">
       <div class="card-body">
           <div class="table-responsive">
               <table id="tableName" class="table table-hover">
                   <!-- table content -->
               </table>
           </div>
       </div>
   </div>
   ```

4. **Added Bootstrap 5 modals:**
   - Replace inline forms
   - Better UX (no page navigation)
   - Form validation with visual feedback
   - Required field indicators

5. **Added DataTables initialization:**
   ```javascript
   $(document).ready(function() {
       initDataTable('#tableName', {
           order: [[0, 'desc']],
           columnDefs: [
               { orderable: false, targets: -1 } // Actions column
           ]
       });
   });
   ```

6. **Added JavaScript functions:**
   - `resetForm()` - Clear modal form
   - `editItem(data)` - Populate form for editing
   - `deleteItem(id, name)` - SweetAlert2 confirmation
   - Toast notifications for success/error

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

1. **Efficient SQL Queries:**
   - LEFT JOINs for counts
   - GROUP BY to aggregate
   - LIMIT to prevent large datasets

2. **DataTables:**
   - Client-side processing for < 1000 rows
   - Pagination reduces DOM load
   - Search uses indexing

3. **CDN Libraries:**
   - Cached globally
   - Parallel downloads
   - Minified versions

4. **Lazy Loading:**
   - Modals load on demand
   - Charts render when visible
   - Parts modal fetches via AJAX

---

## 📝 SQL Queries Used

### **Vehicles with Work Order Count:**
```sql
SELECT v.*, 
       CONCAT(c.first_name, " ", c.last_name) AS customer_name,
       COUNT(w.work_id) as work_count
FROM vehicle v 
JOIN customer c ON c.customer_id = v.customer_id 
LEFT JOIN working_details w ON v.vehicle_id = w.vehicle_id
GROUP BY v.vehicle_id
ORDER BY v.vehicle_id DESC 
LIMIT 200
```

### **Mechanics with Work Order Count:**
```sql
SELECT m.*, 
       COUNT(w.work_id) as work_count
FROM mechanics m
LEFT JOIN working_details w ON m.mechanic_id = w.assigned_mechanic_id
GROUP BY m.mechanic_id
ORDER BY m.mechanic_id DESC 
LIMIT 200
```

### **Work Orders List:**
```sql
SELECT w.work_id, w.status, w.start_date, w.completion_date, w.total_cost, 
       CONCAT(c.first_name, " ", c.last_name) AS customer, 
       CONCAT(v.year, " ", v.make, " ", v.model) AS vehicle, 
       s.service_name
FROM working_details w 
JOIN customer c ON c.customer_id=w.customer_id 
JOIN vehicle v ON v.vehicle_id=w.vehicle_id 
JOIN service_details s ON s.service_id=w.service_id 
ORDER BY w.work_id DESC 
LIMIT 100
```

### **Work Order Details:**
```sql
SELECT w.*, 
       CONCAT(c.first_name, " ", c.last_name) AS customer_name, 
       CONCAT(v.year, " ", v.make, " ", v.model) AS vehicle_info, 
       CONCAT(m.first_name, " ", m.last_name) AS mechanic_name, 
       s.service_name
FROM working_details w 
JOIN customer c ON c.customer_id=w.customer_id 
JOIN vehicle v ON v.vehicle_id=w.vehicle_id 
JOIN mechanics m ON m.mechanic_id=w.assigned_mechanic_id 
JOIN service_details s ON s.service_id=w.service_id 
WHERE w.work_id=:id
```

## 🎯 Business Logic

### **Vehicle Rules:**
1. VIN must be exactly 17 characters
2. Year must be between 1900-2100
3. Mileage must be non-negative
4. Cannot delete if work orders exist

### **Mechanic Rules:**
1. Email must be valid format
2. Hourly rate must be numeric
3. Hired date required
4. Active status controls availability
5. Cannot delete if work orders exist

### **Work Order Rules:**
1. All fields required (customer, vehicle, mechanic, service)
2. Labor cost = Hourly Rate × Estimated Hours
3. Total cost = Labor + Parts
4. Status workflow: Pending → In Progress → Completed
5. Completion date only when status = completed
6. Auto-create invoice when completed
7. Historical record (no delete)
