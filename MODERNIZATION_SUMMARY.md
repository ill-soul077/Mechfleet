## 📊 Database Queries Optimized

### Dashboard Queries
```sql
-- Total Customers
SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM customer

-- Active Work Orders
SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM working_details WHERE status != 'Completed'

-- Monthly Revenue
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(amount), 0) as total 
FROM income 
WHERE MONTH(date) = MONTH(CURRENT_DATE()) 
  AND YEAR(date) = YEAR(CURRENT_DATE())

-- Revenue Trend (Last 6 Months)
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(date, '%b') as month,
    COALESCE(SUM(amount), 0) as revenue
FROM income
WHERE date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH)
GROUP BY YEAR(date), MONTH(date)
ORDER BY date ASC

-- Work Order Status Distribution
SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count
FROM working_details
GROUP BY status
```

### Customers Page Query
```sql
SELECT c.*, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT v.vehicle_id) as vehicle_count,
       COUNT(DISTINCT w.work_id) as work_count
FROM customer c
LEFT JOIN vehicle v ON c.customer_id = v.customer_id
LEFT JOIN working_details w ON c.customer_id = w.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id
ORDER BY c.customer_id DESC 
LIMIT 200
```
