# Work Order Inventory Management - Complete Guide

## ✅ Current Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

Your work order system **already has** automatic inventory decrement functionality working correctly. When you create a work order with parts, the inventory is automatically decremented.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### Backend Flow (work_orders.php)

1. **Work Order Creation**
   - User fills out the work order form
   - User optionally adds parts needed for the repair
   - Form is submitted with POST action='create'

2. **Database Transaction**
   ```php
   // Step 1: Create work order
   INSERT INTO working_details (...) VALUES (...)
   
   // Step 2: Add parts (if any)
   foreach ($part_products as $product_id, $quantity) {
       addWorkPart($pdo, $work_id, $product_id, $quantity);
   }
   ```

3. **Inventory Decrement** (in `addWorkPart()` function)
   ```php
   // business.php - addWorkPart() function
   - Lock product row (FOR UPDATE)
   - Validate stock availability
   - Insert/update work_parts record
   - Decrement inventory: UPDATE product_details SET stock_qty = stock_qty - quantity
   - Update work order totals (parts_cost, total_cost)
   - Commit transaction
   ```
