## 🔧 Technical Details

### Delete Functionality

**Backend (PHP):**
```php
elseif ($action === 'delete') {
    $work_id = (int)($_POST['work_id'] ?? 0);
    
    // Get work order details
    $checkStmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT status FROM working_details WHERE work_id = :id');
    $checkStmt->execute([':id' => $work_id]);
    $workOrder = $checkStmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
    
    // Only allow deletion of completed work orders
    if ($workOrder['status'] !== 'completed') {
        throw new RuntimeException('Can only delete completed work orders');
    }
    
    // Start transaction
    $pdo->beginTransaction();
    
    try {
        // Delete related work parts
        $stmt = $pdo->prepare('DELETE FROM work_parts WHERE work_id = :id');
        $stmt->execute([':id' => $work_id]);
        
        // Delete related income records
        $stmt = $pdo->prepare('DELETE FROM income WHERE work_id = :id');
        $stmt->execute([':id' => $work_id]);
        
        // Delete the work order
        $stmt = $pdo->prepare('DELETE FROM working_details WHERE work_id = :id');
        $stmt->execute([':id' => $work_id]);
        
        $pdo->commit();
        $msg = 'Work order deleted successfully';
    } catch (Throwable $e) {
        $pdo->rollBack();
        throw $e;
    }
}
```

**Frontend (HTML/JavaScript):**
```html
<!-- Delete button (only for completed) -->
<?php if ($r['status'] === 'completed'): ?>
    <button onclick='deleteWorkOrder(...)' class="btn btn-sm mf-btn-icon text-danger">
        <i class="fas fa-trash-alt"></i>
    </button>
<?php else: ?>
    <button disabled title="Cannot delete: Work order is <?= $r['status'] ?>">
        <i class="fas fa-trash-alt"></i>
    </button>
<?php endif; ?>

<!-- JavaScript function -->
<script>
function deleteWorkOrder(id, description) {
    confirmDelete(
        `Are you sure you want to delete this completed work order?\n\n${description}`,
        function() {
            document.getElementById('deleteWorkOrderId').value = id;
            document.getElementById('deleteForm').submit();
        }
    );
}
</script>
```

### Parts Modal Fix

**Before (Broken):**
```html
<form onsubmit="return savePart(event)">
  <label>Product</label><br />
  <select name="product_id" required>
    <!-- options -->
  </select>
  <br /><label>Quantity</label><br />
  <input type="number" name="quantity" value="1" min="1" />
  <button type="submit">Add</button>
</form>
<div id="part-msg" class="muted"></div>
```

**After (Fixed):**
```html
<form id="addPartForm" onsubmit="return savePart(event)">
  <input type="hidden" name="work_id" value="<?= $work_id ?>" />
  
  <div class="mb-3">
    <label for="partProduct" class="form-label">Product <span class="text-danger">*</span></label>
    <select class="form-select" id="partProduct" name="product_id" required>
      <option value="">Select Product</option>
      <!-- Products with SKU and stock -->
    </select>
  </div>
  
  <div class="mb-3">
    <label for="partQuantity" class="form-label">Quantity <span class="text-danger">*</span></label>
    <input type="number" class="form-control" id="partQuantity" name="quantity" value="1" min="1" required />
  </div>
  
  <div id="part-msg" class="alert alert-info d-none"></div>
  
  <div class="d-flex justify-content-end gap-2">
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" onclick="closeModal()">
      <i class="fas fa-times me-2"></i>Cancel
    </button>
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">
      <i class="fas fa-plus me-2"></i>Add Part
    </button>
  </div>
</form>
```

**JavaScript improvements:**
- Loading spinner while saving
- Success/error messages with icons
- Bootstrap alert classes

### Create Work Order Form Fix

**Changes Made:**
1. Added form ID: `<form id="workOrderForm" method="post">`
2. Enhanced resetForm() function
3. Added auto-close modal on success
4. Remove validation classes on reset

**resetForm() function:**
```javascript
function resetForm() {
    document.getElementById('workOrderForm').reset();
    document.getElementById('customerId').value = '';
    document.getElementById('vehicleId').value = '';
    document.getElementById('mechanicId').value = '';
    document.getElementById('serviceId').value = '';
    document.getElementById('status').value = 'pending';
    document.getElementById('startDate').value = '<?= date('Y-m-d') ?>';
    document.getElementById('notes').value = '';
    // Remove validation classes
    document.querySelectorAll('#workOrderForm .is-invalid, #workOrderForm .is-valid').forEach(el => {
        el.classList.remove('is-invalid', 'is-valid');
    });
}
```

**Auto-close on success:**
```javascript
<?php if ($msg): ?>
    showSuccess('<?= addslashes($msg) ?>');
    // Close modal after successful creation
    setTimeout(function() {
        const modal = bootstrap.Modal.getInstance(document.getElementById('workOrderModal'));
        if (modal) modal.hide();
    }, 100);
<?php endif; ?>
```

## 📊 Database Impact

### Tables Modified:

1. **`working_details`**
   - Delete removes work order record
   - Status checked before deletion

2. **`work_parts`**
   - Delete cascades (removes all parts for work order)
   - Add inserts new part record
   - Updates work order total cost

3. **`income`**
   - Delete cascades (removes all payments for work order)
   - Auto-created when work order marked completed

### Transaction Safety:

All delete operations use database transactions:
```php
$pdo->beginTransaction();
try {
    // Delete operations
    $pdo->commit();
} catch (Throwable $e) {
    $pdo->rollBack();
    throw $e;
}
```

This ensures:
- ✅ All deletions succeed together
- ✅ Or all deletions fail together
- ✅ No partial data corruption
- ✅ Database integrity maintained
