# üîß MECHFLEET - HOW TO TEST PARTS FUNCTIONALITY

## ‚úÖ WHAT I FIXED

1. **Fixed modal reload bug** - Now properly reloads the work order page after adding parts
2. **Added detailed logging** - Browser console shows every step of the process
3. **Fixed SQL security issue** - All queries use prepared statements

## üåê STEP-BY-STEP BROWSER TEST

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Check "Cached images and files"
3. Click "Clear data"
4. Close ALL browser tabs

### Step 2: Open Browser Console (IMPORTANT!)
1. Open a new browser tab
2. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
3. Click on "Console" tab
4. Keep it open during the test

### Step 3: Open Work Order #93
Go to:
```
http://localhost/Mechfleet/public/work_orders.php?id=93
```

You should ALREADY see parts added from my earlier test:
- **Parts Cost: $179.97**
- **Total Cost: $277.47**
- **Parts Used table** showing: Wheel Bearing x3

### Step 4: Add a NEW Part
1. Click "Add Part" button
2. **Watch the console** - you'll see: `[openPartsModal] Opening modal for work order: 93`
3. Select any product from dropdown
4. Enter quantity (e.g., 2)
5. **Watch the console** - you'll see stock validation
6. Click "Add Part" button to submit
7. **Watch the console** - you'll see:
   - `[savePart] Form submitted`
   - `[savePart] work_id: 93`
   - `[savePart] Sending request to api/add_work_part.php`
   - `[savePart] Response status: 200 OK`
   - `[savePart] Parsed JSON: {success: true, ...}`
   - `[savePart] Success! Closing modal and reloading page...`
   - `[savePart] Reloading to: work_orders.php?id=93&t=...`

8. Page will reload automatically
9. The NEW part will appear in "Parts Used" table
10. Parts Cost and Total Cost will increase

### Step 5: Test Other Work Orders
- http://localhost/Mechfleet/public/work_orders.php?id=96
- http://localhost/Mechfleet/public/work_orders.php?id=95
- http://localhost/Mechfleet/public/work_orders.php?id=94

Each one uses the SAME code - it's universal!

## üö® IF IT DOESN'T WORK

**Check the browser console (F12) and tell me EXACTLY what you see:**

### Scenario A: Console shows "Unauthorized"
- You're not logged in
- Go to login page first

### Scenario B: Console shows error message
- Copy the EXACT error and send it to me

### Scenario C: Nothing happens when you click "Add Part"
- Check if modal opens
- Check console for JavaScript errors

### Scenario D: Modal opens but submit does nothing
- Check console for network errors
- Make sure you're selecting a product with stock

## üìù WHAT TO TELL ME

If it still doesn't work, send me a screenshot of:
1. The browser console (F12) after clicking "Add Part"
2. The exact error message you see
